# Matplotlib Homework - The Power of Plots

## Pymaceuticals Instructions

In this exercise, I have joined the fictional Pymaceuticals, Inc. as a Data Analyst, and I am assigned to draw insights their most recent anti-cancer experiments.

In this study, 250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time. My objective is to analyze the data to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare.

Conclusions:

1. Infubinol and Ketapril closely track the tumor growth in mice given the placebo. Not only does Capomulin prevent growth of the tumor, but in fact substantially decreases its volume by 10%. This first graph shows the promise of Capomulin.

2. The metastatic sites graph has a more varied result. While Ketapril follows the placebo, both Infubinol and Capomulin are able to significantly slow the growth of M. sites, but Capomulin still is the most effective at this point. 

3. There are no lucky mice in a cancer trial, but those administered Capomulin retain above 80% survival rates compares to their peers, that all dip below 50 on track with the placebo. 

Obviously cancer research requires many more, and much more complicated tests than these, but throughout all of our graphs Capomulin has shown the most potential and deserves further investment and research for potential medical purposes.
